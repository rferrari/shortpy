# üìâ Crypto SHORT Signal Discord Bot

This is a **Discord bot** that scans the crypto futures market on Binance for potential **SHORT trading signals**, based on **Fibonacci retracements**, **EMA**, and **price action patterns**. It filters assets by market capitalization using CoinGecko, performs analysis, and posts alerts to a Discord channel for manual confirmation.

---

## üöÄ What It Does

- Connects to Binance Futures and CoinGecko APIs.
- Filters coins with a market cap between `$100M` and `$950M`.
- Matches these with available perpetual futures on Binance.
- Retrieves recent price data (`15m` interval).
- Calculates **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**.
- Applies two signal strategies:
  - **Reversal detection** (based on Fibonacci 0.618 retracement + EMA).
  - **Continuation detection** (based on price momentum + EMA).
- Posts a message in a Discord channel when a signal is detected.
- Waits for a manual `ok` confirmation from any user to simulate trade execution.

## üìä Strategy Breakdown

### Reversal Strategy

* Checks if the current price is below both:

  * The **0.618 Fibonacci retracement** level from recent high/low.
  * The **21-period EMA**.
* If both are true, a possible **reversal SHORT** opportunity is flagged.

### Continuation Strategy

* Confirms upward movement if:

  * The last close is above both the previous close and the EMA.
* Used to identify **momentum-based short setups**.

---

## üí¨ Manual Confirmation

Once a signal is posted to Discord:

* A message is sent asking for confirmation: `"ok"`
* If someone replies with `ok` within 30 seconds, it simulates a trade confirmation.
